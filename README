Hello!

This is a forked copy of the maven-trinidad-plugin originally
maintained by Gojko.  It's forked as of the 20110303 version.

It has been repackaged so I can deploy it to oss.sonatype.org and have
it mirrored to central.  It is still licensed under GPL (but as it
communicates with Maven through the Maven Plugin APIs, GPL's viral
nature stops there).
